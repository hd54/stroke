    "The chances of getting a stroke can often be predicted by certain factors such as glucose level and smoking status. Being able to tell a person if they are categorized to have a higher chance of stroke gives a person a chance to reduce said factors in hopes of preventing a stroke. The question and purpose of our project is to classify a large set of data that gives the factors that lead to stroke and then, when given a new example, predict if the person is likely to have a stroke.\n",
    "The data set is provided on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset), which lists various background clinical features from the patients, such as disease history and age, all potentially useful in predicting a stroke. "

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We use classification since we are more interested in predicting potential strokes rather than finding dependency relationship between stroke and other variables (regression). While the latter helps with finding out causes of stroke (and how strongly they contribute to stroke), classification provides a useful warning as it allows the patient to be more aware of their lifestyle and allows doctors to be more proactive in diagnosis and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our model, we split our initial data so that 75% (seem to be the standard percentage) will be used in the training data and the rest for the test data. We also need to set a seed so that the code is reproducible. We will then build the model using the optimal K value found from tuning the number of nearest neighbors on the training data. (This has been done in the EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using K-nearest neighbours classification since we are trying to predict and categorize an example into two groups, having a stroke and not having a stroke. KNN works best with categeorical data and clustering (Campbell et al., 2022). As seen with the peliminary data analysis we can see our data tends to cluster so this would be an apporiate model to use. Then once this is trained, we can obtain a new example and predict weather or not this person will have a stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three columns from the dataset will be used in this study: age, BMI, and average blood glucose level. These three variables are chosen not only because they are three important factors that contribute to an individual’s risk of developing stroke, but their continuous property makes it easier to establish the correlation with having a stroke. To visualize the relationship between the three factors and with stroke, we will produce three scatter plots: age vs. BMI, age vs. average blood glucose level, and finally BMI vs. average blood glucose level. All three plots will have datapoints color labeled to show the history of stroke (have had stroke or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that our data set is heavily unbalanced, in which the number of observations in the majority class (non-stroke) is roughly 20 times bigger compared to the number of observations in the minority (stroke). \n",
    "\n",
    "We are downsampling our data because since there are so many examples of people who have not experienced a stroke. This results in the model having tendency to misclassify people having strokes to be in non-stroke group. This drowns out the intricate details we are trying to find that may indicate one person is likely to have a stroke. We have learned that picking a random sample of a population is just as effective to use data of the whole population so we are using this knowlege here, by using equal parts of the data which uses exmaples who have and haven't had a stroke."

    "In medical scenarios, these situations are generally expected. Since the data set is unbalanced, this would mean a that new observations will be too heavily influenced by the majority class (Dev et al., 2022). Thus, rebalancing the data is necessary, and as Dev et al. has suggested, downsampling is recommended as it helps reduce this adverse effect and, in fact, is used as part of the authors' experiment in classifying strokes. Downsampling is also well-known around nearest neighbors algorithm (Lee et al., 2022). Therefore, we will apply downsampling on the current data set, as it has been shown to work effectively.'step_downsample' allows us to do so, as we specify the 'under_ratio' specifying the ratio $\\frac{\\text{#majority}}{\\text{#minority}}$. Setting it to be 1.85 means that we will be cutting down majority class data until the number of majority class data is $1.85$ times the number of minority class data."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model shows that that peak accuracy is obtained at $k = 57$ (using 57 nearest neighbors for classification). The model obtains roughly 77% accuracy when predicting strokes from new observations, which come from our split data for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through experimentation with various downsampling ratios, a ratio of 1.85 yielded superior accuracy compared to a ratio of 1 to 5. \n",
    "To address the imbalanced nature of the dataset and its distinct characteristics, the unsampling method was selected as a means of dataset balancing and computational cost reduction. so our balance choose $under \\ ratio = 1.85$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's accuracy turns out to be smaller than expected, around 77% when tested on new observations. This does not necessarily mean that the model is bad, however. According to Lee et al., in most cases, classifying a majority class observation as minority (in this case, false positive) are generally much better than the opposite (false negatives). It makes sense in our case why we want to avoid misclassifying as non-stroke, since doing so might put the patient and medical team in a passive state when there is a lurking danger of a stroke, and also there are no serious consequences if we classify a healthy person as stroke-likely. The confusion matrix shows this pattern, as it can detect a high number of stroke accurately, 37 out of 53 cases (even though it can be improved) and has a lot of false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't consider k values beyond 101 to avoid overfitting. While 57 is a quite big k value, we argue it's within reasonable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of the findings is directly linked to the main question of this report. With this classification model, we can now accurately predict whether a person is likely to develop a stroke or not and look into whether a part of their lifestyle is significantly contributing to this probability. This means that the medical team can be proactive in their treatments if such unfortunate events occur, and for the patient, promote a healthy lifestyle change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is based on downsampling. According to Lee et al., however, a disadvantage of downsampling method is that a loss of information is gauranteed since we are cutting down the data from the majority class, and if we're unlucky we may lose very useful information. Another approach to the problem is to instead use the upsampling method to fix the unbalanced data, although there is a risk of unnecessary duplication. Instead of cutting down or increase data size, a cost-sensitive learning approach (adding weights to each data point) can be rather effective (Lee et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing this stroke predictor, we hope to use a set of conditions that could potentially contribute to the development of strokes to predict whether an individual will develop their first stroke in the future. We will also examine the accuracy of this predictor for any future improvements. In a real-life setting, this predictor can be used for stroke prevention among high-risk patients and to promote lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of stroke. As this predictor only predicts the first stroke of an individual, while one in four stroke patients in the US (CDC, 2022) experiences a second stroke sometime in their life (Tsao et al., 2022), future work can be done to predict the chance of having multiple strokes based on a more extensive range of health conditions and it could raise new inquiries regarding additional risk factors that could improve the model.\n",
